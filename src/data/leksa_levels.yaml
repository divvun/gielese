## NB: this key is not actually used in any of the code, but just here
## to document the format.


Examples:
  # Each question is an entry in a list

  # Valid types:
  #   "image_to_word"
  #   "word_to_word"
  #   "word_to_image"
  #
  # These govern how to display items in the interface.
  #
  - type: "image_to_word"

    # A category name which determines what set the questions belong to
    # in the UI.
    #
    category: "BODYPART"

    # A name for internal uses (this will not be displayed to users)
    #
    name: "Bodypart image to word"

    # The level is essentially the order that the question comes in
    # progression.
    #
    level: 1

    # Number of answers displayed to the user. 1 - 4

    # Full amount of points awarded. (Points decrease for each second of
    # inactivity)

    # otherwise standard 3-character ISO codes are needed. If the user's
    # interface language is to be used to generate, use the value
    # "USERLANG".
    #
    # For the semantics setting, use a list of semantic sets that must
    # intersect with concepts in the database.
    #
    # TODO: implement alternate things that may select concepts, such as image
