* video support needs a fallback to exceptionally simple quality gif
  - concept directory reader should check file type and mark these
  - modernizr.js (http://modernizr.com/) for h.264 detection
    - http://camendesign.com/code/video_for_everybody

* page flicker probs: 
  - mobileinit works, the settings do not

* iOS 3.5" display is tricky, definitely need to recommend bookmark install.
  maybe include an additional note about how it improves screen experience

  - category icons need shrinking 

* iPad login form could be a bit bigger yet 

* app-cache for certain assets: click sounds, UI icons, etc.

* TODO: positioning of user account/non-user account label for swedish text
  - maybe need to switch display format-- put label somewhere else.
  - maybe only on tablet? don't see anymore.
  - yes

* TODO: points view needs a tablet-friendly view, because now there's room for
  multiple columns and such 

* category complete marking?

-- 

* MISC: clean up media-serv code a little

* MISC: find any hardcoded 'sma' stuff ; generalize.

* global config for app instance: 
  - specifies media directory to parse
  - activity settings (can get rid of leksa_questions, etc.)
  - localization languages to use
  - which language is the language to learn ('sma')

--

* make questions all follow one generic structure, leksa_questions.yaml is too much

+ question cycle tracking ready, now just user question cycle.

* consider what client side events need logging

* simplify question concept fetching by just using the category-- no need to
  define semantics etc., except for with answer similarity, but that can be a
  filter off of the same category's concepts

* make user progression go based on a repetition count of the lessons,
  thus onece you hit end you can restart

#

* email verification? pw reset

* need a means of forcing the app to work offline, independently of whatever
  browser reports

   - online/offline detection in chrome seems to work when wireless turns off.

* things to document: 

  - http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/tutorial.html
  - auth situation
  - html5 audio issues (leksa.coffee -- need to move this elsewhere) 

# Getting going

## Things to read

### Offline sync thoughts

The offline aspect of this app will need to be covered in two ways: 

 * offline caching of media files
 * storage of non-media files in a local database

TODO: write readme section about all the dependencies/things synced for offline
      mode
