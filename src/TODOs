 * TODO: loading screen - test more

 * TODO: wordlist - audio links not working, text too small

 * TODO: i18n / i10n - need to have all resources loaded first

 * TODO: 4 images type

 * TODO: check mÃ¸tereferat for more stuff

 * TODO: wordlist
   - one page not separate pages; different types for different screen widths


 * TODO: intro page - download or not? 
   - use time on intro page to figure out what device to download images for,
     then fetch resources accordingly

 * TODO: store all options in some central place

 * FEATURE: visual map of levels
   * FEATURE: description of question sets

 * TODO: sessions
   - user and sessions model separate

   - possibility to not use server-side session to do things. in that case,
     store all data, and later authenticate when network becomes available, use
     that session to offload data.

   - auth process:
     - client send user/pw (neither are stored)
     - server responds with new session ID
     - client stores session ID, uses session ID to check for data. 

 * FEATURE: UI in three languages: sma, nob, swe.
   - existing code in NDS could be used to extract strings from .js, and manage
     translations with pybabel in typical .po files.

   - translation of concept words should go based on interface language, except
   for when the language is sma, which then requires selection of nob or swe

 * level progression map, once we get more levels designed

 * what about a sound matching game, where you get a board of miscellaneous
   cards, and you have to match the same word but in multiple voices

 * FEATURE: level-by-level enable sound feature, f.eks., in image->sma word,
   may want to have sound off because it's a harder test

 * FEATURE: more points for faster answer

 * FEATURE: each level gets its own amount of points awarded for correct

 * FEATURE: progression of level sets

 * FEATURE: sessions
   * send user progressions, receive from server
   * load session before making games available

 * FEATURE: high scores list

 * BUG: no sound on iPhone 4S, iOS 5.1.1
   - check that SoundManager supports this, and what to do when not

## Things to read

### Offline sync thoughts

The offline aspect of this app will need to be covered in two ways: 

 * offline caching of media files
 * storage of non-media files in a local database

#### Offline media storage

 * applicationCache - good for mobile, and desktop dev.
   - http://caniuse.com/offline-apps
   - should allow for easy discovery of new media files, and will use the cache
     when the user is offline. May be some way to allow the user to force a
     check, or manually set the application into offline mode for when they are
     connected but just don't want the app to update.


#### local DB storage stuff

 * overall, good idea seems to be: get the application working well first, then
   figure out the storage scheme. Backbone.sync handles syncing of online and
   offline data, so this should be fairly easy to override with one or another
   local service when it is detected.

   so far, persistencejs.org looks like a really nice thing to use, but just
   needs some time testing out.

##### Other notes...

 * Lots of entertaining BS involving choice in indexeddb and SQL storage:
    http://caniuse.com/sql-storage
     - supported in iOS browser, mobile chrome and android 
     - not supported in FF (which is nice for mobile development)
     - supported in chrome 
     - deprecated spec

    http://caniuse.com/indexeddb
     - not deprecated
     - supported in chrome, firefox
     - not supported in mobile browsers

   helpful comparison:

   backbone: 
     websql - https://github.com/MarrLiss/backbone-websql
     indexeddb - https://github.com/superfeedr/indexeddb-backbonejs-adapter

   migrating websql to indexedb
     http://www.html5rocks.com/en/tutorials/webdatabase/websql-indexeddb/

   phonegap has own implementation for devices without local SQL
   storage, which is compatible with spec

     http://docs.phonegap.com/en/1.2.0/phonegap_storage_storage.md.html

   also: http://persistencejs.org/

 * So, needs for offline storage: 
   - storing user progression/details between sessions (trying to solve
     this before something like phonegap comes in) 

   - storing individual exercises and concept data
     ALTERNATIVES:
     - create .js file for static things like concepts and questions, include
       in applicationCache, generate on server for sync, store user data in 
       localStorage

### game name

? 

### Lexical, sound, and image data

 * Use existing Oahpa source files for words

 * create extension .xml files for related images and sounds, lemma can be 
   as detailed as it needs to be, and matching will go with most detailed first, 
   so that we don't need to spend too much time duplicating info, but if
   we need to match class="IV" vs class="TV", or hid="1" (govledh vs
   govledh, svieredh, etc), we can.

      <mg>
         <!-- 
         if this is present, we can use it for including any additional
         meanings that need to be included, otherwise, just use
         additional data that was specified in previously installed
         lexicon files, n_smanob.xml, v_smanob.xml, etc.
         -->
      </mg>

### Module formats

#### Database planning

 * Concepts 
   - language (sma, img)
   - type (word, img, sound)
   - semantic tags (family, animate, animal, etc.)
   - feature tags (bisyl, umlaut, round obj, etc.)
     - will use these to produce examples that are similar in sound or
       appearance
   - translations (related objects in other lang)

 * Progression
   - track user history, accuracy rate for game, game type, Concept success
     rate; 
   - try to determine whether users need to work on a specific concept, game
     type, or game

 * Questions

#### Wordlist

##### Word model

 * semantic info
 * basic word / peripheral
 * frequency
 * difficult wordpairs / oppositions (td rj vs jr, etc)
 * image files
   - different resolutions
 * sound files

#### Leksa

##### Simple words

 * Q: individual image
   A: one of several words (sma)
 
 * Q: individual word (sma)
   A: one of several images
 
 * Q: sma word
   A: 1 of nob words
 
 * Q: nob word
   A: 1 of sma words

###### UI

 - question
 - answers
 - Sound button(s) for printed words
 
 - show learning progression, or progress on exercise? Progress bar, 1/10, 2/10, 3/10, etc.,?

###### Features

 - wrong words from either similar semantic words, or similar orthographic form
   (edit distance 2)
 
 - progression: word -> image - show first one image, then two, then four 
 - keep track of individual user/word learning progression
 
 - be able to clear learning progression
 - store in oahpa
 
 - need to track: 
   * times word has been shown as a correct answer (?)
   * times user has guessed word correctly/incorrectly
   * times user has played game
