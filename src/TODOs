## Today

* disable link on level one auto-advance, users can get points with no work by
  clicking answers

* high scores endpoint for anonymous users?

* stats link visible everywhere

* duplicates appearing again
  - some problem in question.litcoffee that also makes a question unrenderable


* Tsåahka - missing words - missing concept directory

* TODO: https://github.com/okamototk/jqm-mobile-bookmark-bubble

* safari favorite icon

** funksjonalitet med video

* login form needs more work
 - error fields not highlighted in certain instances?
 - enter login info, then choose a language ; data deleted - must store
   temporarily until form is submitted, then delete

* poeng: går raskare ned for meir avanserte nivå (5 poeng per halv? kanskje, meir om det seinare) sekund?)

* chart doesn't work on mobile: http://bl.ocks.org/mbostock/5682158

* user logs

    - category
    - level
    
    - test while logged in, test syncing

* clean up media-serv code a littl

* find any hardcoded 'sma' stuff ; generalize.

* global config for app instance: 
  - specifies media directory to parse
  - activity settings (can get rid of leksa_questions, etc.)
  - localization languages to use
  - which language is the language to learn ('sma')

* converting media: 

  - TODO: new media - time
  - TODO: make questions all follow one generic structure, leksa_questions.yaml is too much

* front page yes/no buttons
  - use opacity for color probs maybe? 

* larger version of logo for tablet

+ question cycle tracking ready, now just user question cycle.


* consider what client side events need logging

* simplify question concept fetching by just using the category-- no need to
  define semantics etc., except for with answer similarity, but that can be a
  filter off of the same category's concepts

* for some reason changing UI lang doesn't reload translations-- any way to refresh from gettext 

* TODO: level one shouldn't track user answers since it's more or less a
  slideshow, but need to have this represented in source somehow so that
  level cycling doesn't get messed with.

* make user progression go based on a repetition count of the lessons,
  thus onece you hit end you can restart

* manglar rullesjakt i ordlista når ein rullar (=vanskeleg å vita om ein har kome til slutten/starten, og kor lang lista er)
  - problem, CSS and scrolling is really awkwardly suported across browsers. 


+ TODO:  new media sets: 
  * create various image sizes
  * define category images
  * check that semantic sets match up with leksa level definition
  * there may be some complexity to simplify now, which can be seen while
    adding new categories.

 + TODO: canvas stats graph doesn't work on android, maybe need an alternate

 + TODO: audio doesn't play automatically on gielese.no / maybe just
   generally -- likely a problem with being able to download resources in
   time.

 + TODO: missing image for mielhke 

 + TODO: server-synced objects stored in localStorage sometimes are extra
   persistent, usersettings will have multiple objects for each setting,
   matching revisions. Need to clear these things from localstorage. 

    ? when in various workflows should Collection.storage.clear() be called?
      only destroys storage, not local models stored in memory.

      localStorage appears to be synced when synced with server as well, but 
      what happens when there's no connection?

    ? might be an issue of not clearing on login before settings are
      downloaded-- check that.

 + TODO: all media sizes need to be available for the frontend to select and
   download, but need to figure out:

     + added device and size attributes to image files and image concepts

     * how many files is this, and will they all need to
       be downloaded, or designate one concept as the "title" concept

 + TODO: how much question data needs to be stripped before sending to server? 

 + TODO: bower, backbone and jquery mobile -- get these dependencies figured
    out in `bower`, consider this documentation. brunch will automatically track
    and install dependencies in bower, making less work for additional
    developers to jump in

#

* email verification? pw reset

* need a means of forcing the app to work offline, independently of whatever
  browser reports

   - online/offline detection in chrome seems to work when wireless turns off.

* things to document: 

  - http://api.mongodb.org/python/current/tutorial.html
  - auth situation
  - html5 audio issues

# Next

 * TODO: persistent storage of concepts in localStorage, block usage of
   leksa, wordlist until they're ready

   - need to be able to download and sync models from server, but rely on
     localStorage, such that models will be used from that first when present
     and when the page loads... Then trigger sync and fetch later.

# Getting going

 * http://jquerymobile.com/
 * http://backbonejs.com/
 * http://brunch.io/

## Things to read

### Offline sync thoughts

The offline aspect of this app will need to be covered in two ways: 

 * offline caching of media files
 * storage of non-media files in a local database

TODO: write readme section about all the dependencies/things synced for offline
      mode
